## Data Science Projects ðŸ“ˆ

### Insiders Loyalty Program:
<!--<img src="loyalty_program.png" align="left" width="400"> -->

To deploy a new loyalty program called Insiders, an unsupervised machine learning model of **Clustering** was developed,                                               grouping the customer base according to their similarities.

### Cross-Sell Campaign
To increase the sales team's performance during a Cross Sell campaign, a **Classification** Machine Learning model was developed to generate a purchase propensity score and classify a base of 127 thousand customers. The trained model generated an extra revenue of $25,000,000.00.
