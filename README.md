## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Vitor Ferreira.

On this Github I present projects developed from public data, with resolutions of business problems using Data Science concepts and tools. 

## About me ðŸš€

I have 15 years of professional experience in business management and commercial management. I am an enthusiast for Data Science and believe data analysis will influence more and more the decision-making of companies and leaders, regardless of their area of expertise.

Currently, I am the owner of Metapro, a Consulting and Sales Representative company. In parallel, I develop personal projects as a Data Scientist and Analytics, to gain experience in solving business problems and mastery of data analysis tools.

My professional goal is to make a career change to the Data Science area. Combining this career transition with my experience, I intend to develop creative and sustainable solutions through the use of data, which allows for assertive decision-making and positively reflects on the company's results.

## Data Science Projects ðŸ“ˆ

### Insiders Loyalty Program:
<!--<img src="loyalty_program.png" align="left" width="400"> -->

To deploy a new loyalty program called Insiders, an unsupervised machine learning model of **Clustering** was developed,                                               grouping the customer base according to their similarities.

### Cross-Sell Campaign
To increase the sales team's performance during a Cross Sell campaign, a **Classification** Machine Learning model was developed to generate a purchase propensity score and classify a base of 127 thousand customers. The trained model generated an extra revenue of $25,000,000.00.
